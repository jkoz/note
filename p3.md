# Hydraulic II

### Reservoir
- Store fluid (9x of cap)
- Cool fluid
- Settle sediment
- Outlet, Return, and screen mesh
- Non-pressurized
	- Safer, cheaper, ease of expansion (oil)
	- Placement (has to be above the pump), easier to get contaminated, lower boiling point, suck air
	- 14.7 psi applied on fluid
- Pressurized (Opposite with non-pressurized)

### Hydraulic fluid
- Viscosity
- Oil resistance to flow
- Affected by temperature
- Cleaning properties
- Anti-foaming
- Demulsification (water)
- Oxidization (fluid’s too hot -> oxidize)
- Corrosion protection
- Petroleum $ - best for lub
- Anti-flammable $$ - used in mining
- Biodegradable $$$ - environmental concerns

### Pump
- “Create flow”
- Inlet line
- Low pressure, bigger line compared to pump outlet to prevent cavitation.
- Can use cheaper pump before expensive pump to protect the expensive one from cavitation
- Non-positive - centrifugal (water pump)
- Positive - what go in must come out!
- System relief valve
- Protect the pump
- Sense upstream of the valve (inlet side)
- Pick something heavy, valve on
- Adjust valve, try low idle first, then increase
- Mechanical efficiency is the amount of power required to overcome the internal friction (95% mechanically efficient, 5% wasted to overcome pump friction)
- "Flow is speed" & resistance to flow is pressure
- Vary input speed change vol of a fixed displacement pump. (There’s a max revolution per minute on the pump)

#### Gear
- Positive displacement
- 80 - 85%
- Unbalanced
- Tolerance to contamination
- $
- 1500 ~ 4000 psi
- Oil pump on ICE, charge pump
- no way to compensate for wearing
- low pressure in inlet side, causing cavitation in outlet side

#### Vane
- Positive displacement
- 85 - 80%
- Fixed or variable
- Balance or unbalanced
- Stricter contamination
- $$
- ~3000 psi
- power steering on road
- automatically compensate wear as vanes always force out


#### Piston
- Positive displacement
- 90 - 95%
- Fixed or variable
- Balanced
- Small clearance, susceptible to contamination
- $$$
- ~5000psi
- main hydraulic, air conditioning
- always odd # piston, otherwise 2 pistons can be canceled each other in and out @ the same time
- wash plate never go to zero (3 degree for lub)

## Quiz review
- Velocity is speed expressed as feet per second or meters per second
- Power is the amount of work done in a specific time.
- Hydrostatic - high pressure low flow - hydraulic systems
- Hydrodynamics - low pressure, high flow - torque converter

## Lab: hydraulic jack
- Components
    - Oil
    - Check valves
    - Relief valve (the handle)
    - Actuator
    - Hand Pump
- How much it can lift ?
    - Hand pump: Stroke 5”, Area: 1 in2
    - Piston: Stroke 12 in, Dia 8 in
    - Hand pump ratio: 3:1 bend at 200 lbs; Can lift: 30,159 lb
    1591
- Increase dia of actuator to increase lift cap.
- A hole on threaded top cylinder Limit max travel, oil go back to the tank. 
- A hole on thread rod nut - Jack up, air escape, jack down, air in

- Cylinder drift -> slowly go down because of leakage
- As long as the leak does not overdo the pump, actuators still do the work, but slow

## Lab: Tyrone gear pump
- Vane pump Intra vane always have outlet  pressure
acting on space below intra vane. If we have passageway, we need to flip the
rotor when we want to change direction of the pump. Spring for initial start of
a motor as we don’t have centrifugal force at the beginning.

Eccentric pump (internal gear) -> great torque
ump - pressure limiting
Bia spring wants full flow

Back off system relief before starting run the new installed pump! Especially when the old pump is broken badly, and we don’t know reason.

Actuator

Pressure intensification
Drift
Single acting cylinder: (rely on other force such as gravity or springs to move in the opposite direction)
Double acting (single rod cyl = differential cyl)
Double acting non-differential (power steering)
Single acting
Telescoping cyl

Piston relief
Cylinder cushion - reduce speed of cyl upon reaching the end
Cushion plunger
Return drilling

Anti Cavitation
Circuit relief

Cylinder
Cushion, metering out
Cylinder relief valve
Hole in cylinder barrel
Flow test
“Inline test” with the pump, good to determine condition of the pump
System relief valve : 3000 psi
Flow meter: 2500 psi
Check flow rate on flow meter show 10GPM compared to pump rated 20 GPM => pump is less than 50% => pump’s done
“Tee test” 
Death end the function (Rod touch bottom) => flow meter show full load reading, and we can check cracking pressure of system relief valve.
Vane motor
Converting oil flow and pressure into speed and force
To increase speed of motor:
Use bigger pump
Use smaller motor
Small gear drive big gear => gear reduction => multiply torque
Drain plug on motor cause back pressure

Ttest internal leakage of motor
Plug out put to tank
Send oil flow to the motor
Take 5 Gal container to hold flow coming from the drain port.
Result:
PRessure relief valve open -> pump OK
Fill up the container quickly before relief valve open -> pump NOK

Test internal leakage of cylinder
Plug return line
Send oil flow to rod end 
Result:
Pressure intensify, no movement = > cyl OK
Piston go up! => cyl pump NOK (too much internal leakage, cyl valve leaks, wear seal).
“Valve = Control”
Pressure Controls
Flow controls
Directional Control

Piston - Lab 
Pitting on cylinder bores, pistons, rods shows cavitation by doing finger nail test
Leaking may happens on piston rod end seals because of cavitation of the rods.
New seal on piston end is just a lip type seal, easy and quick to replace
Old packing contains lots of seals; fixing cost more effort; need remove to whole piston to fix the leak seal.
Big leak -> slow; not lift any more, everything spits on the ground.
Chrome exposed on environment every time extend, weakness!
Piston relief relieves some pressure upon it reach the ends, to slow piston down & reduce torque that may damage dead ends.
Quick drop valve - Lab
Quickly drop/extend piston by pumping oil from rod end to base end (increasing flow rate of pump by using flow rate from rod end)
Power down: 
Accumulator
Store hydraulic energy
Smooth out operation
Maintain pressure, do not need to run the pump all the time.
Without accumulator: heat, fuel, and wear increase as everything underload

Pressure relief
Main Relief
Circuit Relief
Unloader valve
Externally drained
Replace circuit relief valve
Pressure Reducing valve
Internally drained
Sequence valve
Normally closed
Sense upstream of the valve
Drain was blocked, then valve is not opened
Counterbalance
Internally drained
Brake Valve
Prevent the load from overspeeding the motor
Provide a controlled deceleration of the load
Sense upstream and downstream of the motor
Lock Valve
Hold a suspended load in the event of a hydraulic line rupture
Prevent drifting
Prevent load overspeeding the actuator

Pressure Compensated flow control valve	
Orifice creates pressure difference.
Q = A * P (Flow is related to the Area of orifice & the Pressure drop across that orifice.)
The orifice is automatically adjusted to achieve “Inlet Pressure = Spring + outlet pressure)
Bypass type, oil flow back to reservoir; restrict type, restrict inlet (need pressure comp pump)
Flow dividers
Priority flow (steering system)
Proportional flow

Lab review
Extra plugs on the device assist manufacture process only (creating passageway)
EF : excess flow
CF : control flow
Orifice does not control flow; to control flow, oil should direct to tank, or pump must be de-washed

## Exam 1 review
9. Strainer size by mesh (number of boxes on 1 square inch), 
11. drive shaft end determine rotation of the vane pump
14 Positive displacement pump maintains relatively constant volume regardless of resistant to flow
19. Pressure pike cause cracking of pump component, drive shaft shear of, seal leakage.
31. Scoring of the pistons in a piston motor would cause lower motor speed, just like engine, oil go back to tank-> less oil flow -> reduce speed.
39 Flow is speed, not pressure or force
50. Protect filter when starting with cold oil, (by pass valve in oil filter) (prevent blowing filter)

Restrictor type’s Spring’s broken -> press diff decrease

38. Sequence valve is external drained (IM RIGHT HERE, just for ref)


### Compare hydraulic & electrical
- Hydraulic: pump create flow, load determine pressure
- Electrical: battery create voltage, load determine current flow

## Directional Control Valves

- Positions / how is it centered
- How many ports/ways: NO/NC, motor spool, float, P.B. (power beyond)
    - Float work well with round contour
- How it's actuated
    - Proportioning (solenoid) Electronic controls pilot circuit, running at constant psi
    - Discrete solenoid: on/off
    - Air (on/off)
    - Hydraulic
    - Wheels
    - Mechanical
- Detents
    -create void at rod end if shock load

## Formula

$$HP = GPM * PSI * 0.000.7 (80\\%\ efficiency)$$
$$HP = {{GPM * PSI} \over 1714}\ (100\\%\ efficiency)$$

## Hydraulic systems

<!--$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$-->
<!--[![Screenshot][ss]][ssbig]-->

## Open Center hydraulic systems (constant flow system)  

- Cheap
- has unrestricted path to tank
- Least efficient, powered can be wasted in form of heat
- Used on haul truck as the system is not operated during a high % of duty cycle
- Fixed displacement pump, vary speed of engine causing vary speed of the pump
- Waste 7HP in neutral

## Constant horse power - open center

- Destroke pump when pressure rises to limit the maximum power that the pumps can draw from the engine
- Applications: Excavator, faster speed @ lighter load, lower speed @ heavier load
- If the pump is not destroke, the engine would stall for its limit capacity

## Pressure compensation

- Ability to lower flow as output pressure increase
- Bias spring wants full flow
- Waste 1.75HP in neutral

## Closed center system (demand flow system)

- Maintain maximum system pressure available to perform work by accumulator
- Waste 7HP in neutral

## Load sense (closed center)

- Waste 0.14HP in neutral

**Open loop circuit**: returned oil from actuators flow back to tank
**Closed loop circuit/HST**: returned oil from actuators flow back to pump inlet

## Cat 246
- Hydrostatic test
    - 4 quad gauges
    - Laptop
    - up on stands, tires rotating                                                                      

## Cat 315: Big excavator (constant horse power)
- The boom / stick and bucket will NOT move

**Close flowmeter a little bit to warm things up**

## JD 344: loader
- T test, have parallel path to tank, may close orifice off, oil are lazy, it will go to tank
## Cat 277 Skid steer loader (Multi terrain loader)
- Test loader function
- Can move
- Laptop, flowmeter on auxiliry port
- Series test
- use transducer
## Cat 305D: little excavator

focus on the boom

# IHET2302 - Steeering and Suspension Systems and Accessories

- Steering
    - rigid frame
        - Front wheel steering
        - Rear wheel steering: fork lift, combine
        - Four wheel steering
            - Crab steering: maximum rotation, each wheel is on track
            - Co-ordinated (circle) steering: tire turning radius
        - Combination steering: crab, 2 & 4 wheels
        - Skid steering (skid steer loader)
            - with wheels or with tracks
            - control with pump, left & right track
    - non rigid frame units: Wheels not responsible for steering (articulated steering)
        - wiggle wagon (cab & box can be osciallated), loader, & grader, anything that is articulated
    - some system, pilot system has first priority such as loader, (don't have pilot control, we can not do any things else)
    - same feel no matter what engine rpm, steering should have the same feeling. We need flow control
    - Ackerman principle
    - HMU is a pilot control; controlling streering control valve
    - Neutralizer valves stop steering when it hit the end of travel by cutting hydraulic power
    - Need physical stop pin in case of the spring fails in the HMU
    - The pin is also the drive for the pump
    - 225 / 45 / 17
        - tire width 225
        - aspect ratio 45% of its width, Rubber band of tire
        - size of rim 17in
    - camber: inward and outward of grader (use for stability)
    - negative camber (/----\): improve stability & connering, but causing more tire wear (if we don't drive fast, don't need negative camber)
    - positive camber (\---/): nobody uses it, unless they wants lose stability
    - Tie rod is cheap $80
    - Lock pin
    - Steel/rubber cushion: cutting power assist before we hit the stop
    - **micron is a million of meter**
    - Dont use cheap filter, it's function is so important, protecting all the hydraulic system
    - Grader wheels does not help it turning, but help it keep equipment go straight
    - services:
        - seize pin, bushing can hard steering 
        - ensure it safe for the drive before driving the equipment
        - inspect: loose fastener (tie rod), frayed hose, bent fitting, contaminant on cylinder seal
        - avoid articulate point, driver doesn't know.
        - doing cycle time, pressure and load test
        - ensure put safety bar on articulation point (2 people, 1 driver, 1 mechanic)
        - adjust "(little) tow in" every time replace tie rod
        - scraper easily to loose traction, push-pull 1 equipment load at the time
        - cushion hitch is a part of suspension
    - *skid steering*
        - hydrostatic drive: skid steers, excavators, dozers, tank
        - maneuverability: it can turn radius easily 
        - small gear drive big gear => gear reduction => multiply torque
        - Using track provides better flotaion (ability to stay on surface of soft ground), but less traction
- Suspension
- Attachments
- Electrical
- Tracked steering
- Under carriage (clickety-clack)
- Off road drive axle + differential
- Final drive

# IHET2303 - Transmission

- Torque converters
- Powers automatic transmission
- Clutch types (overcenter clutch)
